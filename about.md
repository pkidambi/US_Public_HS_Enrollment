The [** Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) **] (http://www.wiche.edu/) is a regional organization created by the Western Regional Education Compact and adopted in the 1950s by Western states. WICHE was created to facilitate resource sharing among the higher education systems of the West. 


[WICHE] (http://knocking.wiche.edu/download) provides an interface to download the projections, and births and grade-level data related to the projections, based on geographic locations and racial/ethnic groups that you select.  

For this project, I have downloaded the US Public High School trends. In this application, you can select the US state of interest coupled with the type of student and you will see plots of the high school enrollments on a timeline. You will also see the US state of interest highlighted on the US map.

The source code can be downloaded from [GITHUB] (https://github.com/pkidambi/US_Public_HS_Enrollment)
